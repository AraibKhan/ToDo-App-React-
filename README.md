## React ToDo App

This is a small React project that implements a simple ToDo application. The app allows users to create tasks, mark them as complete, update task titles, sort tasks, delete individual tasks, and delete all tasks.

## Features

-Create new tasks: Users can add new tasks by entering a title and clicking the "Add" button. The task will be added to the task list.
-Mark tasks as complete: Users can mark tasks as complete by clicking the checkbox next to each task. The completed tasks will be visually indicated.
-Update task title: Users can update the title of any task by clicking on the task title and editing it. Pressing Enter or clicking outside the input field will save the changes.
-Sort tasks: Users can sort the task list by clicking on the "Sort" button. The tasks will be rearranged in alphabetical order.
-Delete individual tasks: Users can delete a specific task by clicking the "Delete" button next to the task.
-Delete all tasks: Users can delete all tasks at once by clicking the "Delete All" button. A confirmation prompt will appear before deleting all tasks.
